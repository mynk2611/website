## Boosting Productivity: My Go-To Tools for Efficiency

Repetitive tasks can be draining, but the right tools can make a world of difference. Here are the productivity tools I rely on daily to simplify my workflow and boost efficiency.

### 1. Rectangle: Effortless Window Management on macOS  

Managing windows can get tedious, but **Rectangle** makes it seamless on macOS. It’s simple, flexible, and lets you customize keystrokes to manage windows easily.

Here are my personalized shortcuts:

- **Command + Shift + M**: Almost Maximize  
- **Command + Shift + H**: Left Half  
- **Command + Shift + L**: Right Half  
- **Command + Shift + U**: Top Left  
- **Command + Shift + I**: Top Right  
- **Command + Shift + J**: Bottom Left  
- **Command + Shift + K**: Bottom Right  

These shortcuts are lifesavers for multitasking and keeping my workspace organized.

### 2. Zoxide: Smarter Navigation in the Terminal  

If you work on multiple projects, navigating directories manually can be exhausting. **Zoxide**, a smarter `cd` command, remembers your most-used folders and lets you jump between them effortlessly.

For example, I can navigate to my Neovim project folder in seconds without typing the full path every time. It’s an essential tool for anyone working in the terminal.

### 3. Vimium: Keyboard-Driven Browser Navigation  

Switching between the mouse and keyboard while browsing can break your flow. That’s why I use **Vimium**, a browser extension that brings Vim-like keybindings to the web.

Some key shortcuts I use:  
- `?` : Open the help menu  
- `d`/`u` : Scroll down/up half a page  
- `j`/`k` : Scroll down/up one line  
- `r` : Reload the page  

This extension eliminates the need to touch the mouse and makes web navigation faster.

### 4. Shell Config Tweaks: Simplifying Repetitive Commands  

Customizing shell configuration files allows me to save time on repetitive commands. Here are some of my favorite aliases:

#### Git Aliases:  

```bash
alias gcmsg='git commit -m'
alias gh='git push origin HEAD'
alias gs='git status'
alias gaa='git add --all'
alias gd='git diff'
